Initial implementation of appscript code to create a Google sheet
based on a configured schema file, with custom type validation and
data validation across sheets.

* As a google sheets user, I want a spreadsheet generated that matches
  the agreed upon data model and fields for tracking PEMM manuscript data,
  so that I can import and add project data.
    * pull out spreadsheet config into a single data file
    * set up dev environment to support bundling
